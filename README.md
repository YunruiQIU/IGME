# IGME
This code is used to generate Integrative-Generalized-Master-Equation (IGME) models to analyze state-based dynamics.
This file is designed to build a module for Integration Generalized Master Equation (IGME). Actually,
IGME is an algorithm designed for analysing data of Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation based on Generalized
Master Equation (GME) Theory and quasi-Markov State Model (qMSM). Actually it can be understood as
an extended method from qMSM. Using IGME algorithm, the dynamics projected to a lower dimensional space
can be predicted accurately. For quasi-MSM, due to the numerical derivative issues, its results always
fluctuated significantly. IGME algorithm takes advantages of the integration method which can effectively
remove the fluctuations from the MD data.
